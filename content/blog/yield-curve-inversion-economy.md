## Unraveling the Yield Curve: Why the 10–2 and 10–3 Spreads Predict Recessions

**Introduction**

Among finance watchers, few indicators spark as much discussion as the **U.S. Treasury yield curve** and its unusual habit of **inverting** before recessions. In simple terms, the yield curve is a line plotting interest rates on government bonds from short maturities (like 3-month Treasury bills) to long maturities (like 10-year Treasury notes). Normally, this curve slopes upward – longer-term bonds pay higher yields than short-term ones. But occasionally the curve flips upside-down, with short-term yields rising above long-term yields. This rare phenomenon – an **inverted yield curve** – has gained fame as a **warning signal** for economic trouble ahead. In this article, we'll demystify how the yield curve spread (especially the gap between 10-year and 2-year yields, and between 10-year and 3-month yields) works as a predictor of recessions. We'll look at what an inversion means, why it matters, the historical pattern before past U.S. recessions, and what the current curve is suggesting about recession risks in 2025.

## What Is the Yield Curve and Its "Spread"?

The *yield curve* refers to the relationship between bond yields (interest rates) and their maturities. For U.S. Treasuries, it's often visualized as a curve plotting yields for bonds of various terms – from very short (3-month, 1-year) to medium-term (2-year, 5-year) to long-term (10-year, 30-year). Under normal economic conditions, this curve slopes upward. Investors usually demand **higher yields for longer-term bonds** to compensate for the risks of time (like inflation or uncertainty), while short-term bonds have lower yields. In a **normal yield curve**, a 10-year bond's interest rate will be higher than a 2-year bond's rate, which in turn is higher than a 3-month bill's rate. The difference in yield between any two maturities is called a **yield spread** or slope. Two closely watched spreads are: **10-year minus 2-year yield** (often abbreviated "10–2 spread") and **10-year minus 3-month yield** (the spread used by many recession models). A positive spread means the longer-term rate is higher than the shorter-term rate (an upward slope), while a **negative spread** means the curve is inverted (short-term rate higher than long-term).

*Illustration: Typical shapes of the yield curve.* An upward-sloping "normal" curve (top) has higher yields for longer terms; an "inverted" curve (bottom) slopes downward with short-term yields exceeding long-term yields, and a "flat" curve (middle) is nearly horizontal. In practice, the U.S. yield curve tends to be normal during economic expansions, flattens when growth prospects are uncertain, and inverts on the eve of slowdowns. [^1]

## Inverted Yield Curve: A Harbinger of Recession

When the yield curve **inverts**, it signals something very unusual: investors are accepting *lower* returns on long-term bonds than on short-term bonds. Why would they do that? The most common explanation is that **markets expect future interest rates to drop** – typically because of a weakening economy that will force the Federal Reserve to **cut short-term rates**. In other words, an inverted curve reflects a belief that today's high short-term rates won't last; growth and inflation will likely slow, so long-term yields fall in anticipation of easier monetary policy[^2]. An inversion is often interpreted as a vote of *no confidence* in the near-term economy.

When the lines dip below zero, the yield curve is inverted. Shaded gray areas indicate U.S. recessions. As shown, **each recession was preceded by an inversion of the yield curve** – the spreads turned negative before every downturn in recent decades. (Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)

## Why Is the Yield Curve a Leading Indicator?

What makes the yield curve such a reliable predictor of recessions? One main explanation is that it reflects **collective market wisdom**. Bond traders are constantly weighing economic data, policy shifts, and business conditions to make bets on future interest rates[^2]. When a broad consensus of investors expects weakness ahead, the curve inverts. Another explanation is the **financial transmission mechanism** – an inverted yield curve changes borrowing dynamics for banks (who borrow short-term and lend long-term). When short rates exceed long rates, lending becomes less profitable[^3], potentially restricting credit when it's most needed. Finally, there's the **psychological effect** – the attention paid to an inversion can become self-fulfilling as businesses and consumers grow cautious.

## Recent Developments: An Unprecedented Inversion and "Steepening" in 2022–2025

What's particularly noteworthy about our current economic cycle is the **depth and duration** of the yield curve inversion that began in 2022. The 10–2 spread first inverted in July 2022, making this inversion longer than any in modern history. The 10–3 spread followed into negative territory in October 2022. Both spreads remained inverted for nearly two years, with the 10–2 spread reaching a depth of over -100 basis points (1 percentage point) – deeper than any inversion since 1981. Of special interest, the curve began to "steepen" in early 2025, which often happens shortly before recessions materialize. This steepening occurred as the Federal Reserve began its rate-cutting cycle in March 2025. Historically, the curve often un-inverts just before the onset of recession as markets anticipate a series of rate cuts to combat economic weakness.

## Recession Risk in 2025: Reading the Tea Leaves

The persistence and depth of the yield curve inversion that we've experienced strongly suggests elevated recession risk in 2025. According to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the probability of recession within 12 months following a sustained 10–3 inversion is approximately 70%. The recent steepening of the curve, combined with other warning signs like moderating employment growth, declining manufacturing activity, and falling consumer confidence, suggests the economy may be approaching a turning point. 

## Historical Relationship with Recessions

Historically, consumer sentiment has shown both leading and lagging properties with respect to recessions. While sharp declines often precede economic contractions, sentiment can also deteriorate as a result of already weakening economic conditions.

## Current Analysis

Our analysis suggests that the current decline in consumer sentiment is primarily functioning as a leading indicator. The deterioration began before significant changes in unemployment or GDP growth, suggesting that consumers are anticipating economic weakness rather than responding to it.

## Implications for the Economy

The forward-looking nature of the current sentiment decline is concerning, as it suggests consumers may reduce spending in anticipation of harder times ahead. This behavioral change could itself contribute to economic contraction through a self-fulfilling prophecy mechanism.

## What to Watch For

Key metrics to monitor alongside consumer sentiment include:

1. Retail sales data
2. Personal consumption expenditures
3. Credit card spending
4. Savings rates

Divergence between sentiment and actual spending patterns would provide important information about the predictive value of the current sentiment decline.

## Conclusion

The sharp drop in consumer sentiment appears to be signaling future economic weakness rather than reflecting current conditions. This increases the recession probability in our models and suggests that consumer-focused sectors may face headwinds in coming quarters.
